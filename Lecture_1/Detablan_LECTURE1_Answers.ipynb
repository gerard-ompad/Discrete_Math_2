A factorial is defined as $k! = (k)(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)..., \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, note that $0! = 1$. Furthermore, a sum notation $\\Sigma_{k=0}^\\infty k = 0+ 1 + 2 + 3 +....+...$*\n",

    " ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "To prove that Euler's number $e$ is irrational, we'll proceed by contradiction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $e$ is rational, meaning it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers $p$ and $q$, where $q \\neq 0$. So, $e = \\frac{p}{q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "step 2:\n",
    "Recall the definition of $e$ as the sum of the series $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!}$. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e = \\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\ldots $\n",
    "\n",
    "step 3:\n",
    "Now, let's consider the partial sum of the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S_n = \\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{n!} $\n",
    "\n",
    "For some positive integer $n$. Since each term in the series is positive, $S_n$ is increasing and bounded above by $e$, thus $S_n$ converges to $e$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "step 4:\n",
    "Now, let's consider the number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ q! \\cdot S_n = q! \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{n!}\\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "step 5:\n",
    "Expanding this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ q! \\cdot S_n = q! + \\frac{q!}{1!} + \\frac{q!}{2!} + \\frac{q!}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{q!}{n!} $\n",
    "\n",
    "step 6:\n",
    "Every term in this expression is an integer. Also, since $S_n$ converges to $e$, $q! \\cdot S_n$ should be very close to $q! \\cdot e = p$. This implies that $p - q! \\cdot S_n$ should be a very small positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p - q! \\cdot S_n = p - (q! + \\frac{q!}{1!} + \\frac{q!}{2!} + \\frac{q!}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{q!}{n!}) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p - q! \\cdot S_n = p - q! - \\frac{q!}{1!} - \\frac{q!}{2!} - \\frac{q!}{3!} - \\ldots - \\frac{q!}{n!} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p - q! \\cdot S_n = (p - q!) - \\frac{q!}{1!} - \\frac{q!}{2!} - \\frac{q!}{3!} - \\ldots - \\frac{q!}{n!} $\n",
    "\n",
    "step 7:\n",
    "Each term in the parentheses is an integer, and each term in the summation is a fraction with the denominator greater than 1. Thus, $p - q! \\cdot S_n$ must be a non-zero positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this contradicts the fact that $e = \\frac{p}{q}$ because $q! \\cdot S_n$ should be very close to $p$ but is not exactly equal to it, leading to a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our assumption that $e$ is rational must be **false**, and thus $e$ is **irrational**. **QED** \n",

    "To prove Minkowski's inequality for sums, we will use Hölder's inequality. Hölder's inequality states that for any two sequences of real numbers $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ and any $p>1$ such that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$, we have:\n",
