    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experiment consists of a fixed number, $n$, of identical trials.\n",
    "2. Each trial results in one of two outcomes: success, $S$, or failure, $F$.\n",

    "The probability distribution of a binomial experiment is given by the binomial probability formula: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^{k} \\cdot (1 - p)^{n-k}$$ <br>\n",
    "where, $k$ is the number of successess(the value that $Y$ takes). $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes out of $n$ trials <br><br>\n",

    "**Question 2:** Show that the expectation of this probability distribution is $E[y] = \\Sigma y \\cdotp P(y) = np$.\n",
